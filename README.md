# Intoduction-to-Data-Science-687
The course provides applied examples of data collection, processing, transformation, management, and analysis as well as a hands-on introduction to the emerging field of data science. Students will explore key concepts related to data science, including applied statistics, information visualization, text mining and machine learning. “R”, the open source statistical analysis and visualization system, will be used throughout the course. R is reckoned by many to be one of the most popular choice among data analysts worldwide; having knowledge and skill with using it is considered a valuable and marketable job skill for most data scientists. Earning R as a first or second computer language will speed and simplify learning additional scripting skills.
	Learning Objectives
At the end of the course, students are we to be able to explain clearly to a non-expert:
1.	Essential concepts and characteristics of data
2.	The purpose of scripting for data management using R and R-Studio
3.	Principles and practices in data screening, cleaning, linking and visualizations
4.	The importance of clear communication of results to decision makers

At the end of the course, we are expected to be able to do the following tasks independently: 
1.	Identify a problem and the data needed for addressing the problem
2.	Perform basic computational scripting using R 
3.	Transform data through processing, linking, aggregation, summarization, visualization and searching
4.	Interpret basic statistical measures
5.	Organize and manage data at various stages of a project lifecycle
6.	Determine appropriate techniques for analyzing data
